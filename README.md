he main program will display the event of the day. In the case of
multiple events for the same date, the program will choose 1 at random.

The program classifies it's events into 6 categories that may be 
filtered to you liking. The program ships with default events for all days. 
In the settings menu, you may add your own events. Default events and user 
added events will always display regardless of filters applied.

In addition to the ability to add your own events, the program can also
install data paks for specific categories of events. These include famous
Birthdays, Social Science, Religious, Natural, Scientific and War events.
The program has built in features to clean up after itself.

The birthday events do not include notorious criminals (though some are
interesting historically). There will be an add on pak for those who wish
to include these entries.  The default data contains 4 general events for 
every day of the year (including leap years). 

Several add on paks are available at this time. It takes a lot of time to 
write a data pak. More data paks may be released over time.
